The Floating Card component is a more specific Popover which opens on click and has a similar layout to the Card component.

### Example

```jsx
import Button from '../Button/Button';
<FloatingCard title="Card Title" body="Body Content">
  <Button>Open the Floating Card</Button>
</FloatingCard>;
```
