# herz-ui

Herz UI (/hɛrʦ/ - Hérts) is a design system containing a styleguide(colors, grid, icons, typography) and library of UI components


## Usage

Before using the library it's important to include [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) in your project, as Herz-UI components depend on it at the moment.
